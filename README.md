# Turtle Crossing
First complete GUI game with levels, scorekeeping, implementing OOP

```
Note: I am aware this project could use considerable refactoring to make it more robust, implement OOP, etc. 
It is a prototype of a product I would like to eventually build, and only run locally for testing purposes. 
I am currently focused on exploring new concepts rather than perfecting what currently exists.

Did you see the turtle ðŸ’©?
